## 🚀 Features & Fixes

- Aggressive undervolt applied to **CPU clusters** (LITTLE/BIG/PRIME) with stable `schedutil` settings.  
- Optimized **buses & accelerators**: MIF, INT, INTCAM, DISP, CAM, AUD, DSP, DNC, MFC, NPU, TNR.  
- **Max clocks preserved** on BIG/PRIME clusters to prevent throttling.  
- Adjusted **percent margins** to maintain stability under heavy load.  
- **Increased display voltage** improves touch response and prevents ghosting on S20+ OLED/LCD variants.  
- Bug fixes / resolved issues:  
  - ❌ Fixed **touch insensitivity** at high refresh rates  
  - ❌ Resolved **scheduler lag** causing occasional stutter  
- **Thermal control** drastically reduces throttling, increasing **performance and battery life**.
