## 🚀 Features & Fixes

- Aggressive undervolt applied to **CPU clusters** (LITTLE/BIG/PRIME) with stable `schedutil` settings.  
- Optimized **buses & accelerators**: MIF, INT, INTCAM, DISP, CAM, AUD, DSP, DNC, MFC, NPU, TNR.  
- **Max clocks preserved** on BIG/PRIME clusters to prevent throttling.  
- Adjusted **percent margins** to maintain stability under heavy load.  
- **Increased display voltage** improves touch response and prevents ghosting on S20+ OLED/LCD variants.  
- Bug fixes / resolved issues:  
  - ❌ Fixed **touch insensitivity** at high refresh rates  
  - ❌ Resolved **scheduler lag** causing occasional stutter  
- **Thermal control** drastically reduces throttling, increasing **performance and battery life**.

💡 Extra Notes

This module has also been tested on several Galaxy S21 series (Exynos 2100) devices and proved to work with excellent stability and performance.
It also showed compatibility with the Exynos 9 Octa 9820 (Galaxy S10 series).

Additionally, it works on the Galaxy Note 20 series, following the same hierarchy as the S20 series:

Galaxy Note 20 → same compatibility as S20 / S20 FE (Lite Edition)

Galaxy Note 20+ / Note 20 Ultra → same compatibility as S20+ / S20 Ultra (V2 Aggressive Edition)

⚠️ However, for safety and consistency, KØRD officially recommends use only on Exynos 990 devices (Galaxy S20 series).

If you decide to experiment outside of the Exynos 990 line:

Use 🔥UNDERVØLT-990 V2🔥 (Aggressive Edition) on the entire S21 series (Exynos 2100) and on Note 20+ / Ultra.

Use 🔥UNDERVØLT-990-LITE🔥 on the entire S10 series (Exynos 9820) and on Note 20.

Beyond this, no guarantees will be given. Use at your own risk.
